            %p The Mills Computer Club seeks to promote technical skill and professional opportunities for Mills College students interested in Computer Science and its related careers.
            %p Our club members are a mix of undergraduate and graduate students, all with different levels of experience with Computer Science. We seek not just to strengthen our portfolios, academic skill and careers, but also to socialize and have fun!
            %P Mills College is located in Oakland, part of the San Francisco Bay Area. The extensive technical environment in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and the East Bay provides many workshops, conventions, and meet ups that club members are encouraged to attend. Examples of past events include:
            %ul
              %li The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing
              %li Weekly JavaScript study groups, as part of Women Who Code - East Bay
              %li Lesbians Who Tech Summit
              %li ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing
            %p Together with the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, the college also hosts many guest speakers and workshops.
