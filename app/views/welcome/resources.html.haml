                    %a{:name => 'hobbyist'}
                    Yes! For a deeper understanding and ability to adapt to changing technology, a CS degree is invaluable. However, if you want to learn simple code to make tasks easier, learning programming as a hobby is simple. We host many introductory workshops on different topics, such as web development, in addition to encouraging students to take a few CS classes as electives, or as a minor. We also have a growing list of recommended resources for learning languages, shown above.

                    Of course! Our club members are mostly computer science students, but we welcome everyone -- academics and hobbyists alike. The club is perfect for interdisciplinary interests, such as business students wishing to manage technical teams, artists looking to do graphic design, and writers wanting a career in technical writing.
